# apptest-framework

<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/giantswarm/apptest-framework"><img src="https://godoc.org/github.com/giantswarm/apptest-framework?status.svg"></a>

A test framework for helping with E2E testing of Giant Swarm managed Apps within Giant Swarm clusters.

## Features

- Handles test suite setup (using Ginkgo)
- Handles workload cluster creation and deletion
- Provides shared state across test cases
- Provides hooks for pre-install, pre-upgrade and post-install steps

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> The following information is specific to Giant Swarm repos

To ease the setup and bootstrapping of apptests there are two `devctl` commands that setup everything for you.

First, your App repo needs to have the webhooks configured to send to our CI/CD cluster so we can trigger runs from PRs:

```shell
REPO_NAME="example-app" # Change this with your repo name
SHARED_SECRET=""        # This needs to be provided. See the `--help` output for the `ci-webhooks` command for more details

devctl repo setup ci-webhooks --webhook-secret ${SHARED_SECRET} giantswarm/${REPO_NAME}
```

Second, you can scaffold the needed files in the correct place within your repo. Be sure to set the catalog and the app name your app uses within that catalog.

From the root of your App repo:

```shell
devctl gen apptest --repo-name ${REPO_NAME} --app-name ${APP_NAME} --catalog ${CATALOG}
```

Once done your repo should now contain the following:

```plain
ðŸ“‚ tests/e2e
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ suites
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ basic
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ basic_suite_test.go
â”‚     â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ values.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ go.mod
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ go.sum
```

This contains a single test suite called `basic` that without any changes will install your App into the cluster and test for it being marked as "Deployed" successfully.

You can now add your test cases and additional test suites if needed.

## Config.yaml

This framework relies on a `./tests/e2e/config.yaml` file to be present in the repo. This config contains the following properties that can be set based on what is needed by the App.

| property | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `appName` | string | The name of the App as it appears in the catalog |
| `repoName` | string | The name of the repository |
| `appCatalog` | string | The (non-test) catalog that the App is published into |
| `providers` | string array | A list of CAPI providers to test against when triggering from a PR (default if unset `capa`) |

Example:
```yaml
appName: ingress-nginx
repoName: ingress-nginx-app
appCatalog: giantswarm
providers:
- capa
- capv
```

## Running Tests Against a PR

Providing the repo has been setup to make use of `apptest-framework` following the above instructions you can then trigger the configured tests on any open PR by adding the following as a comment:

```
/run app-test-suites
```

This will run all test suites in the App repo against all providers configured in the config.yaml.

If you want to trigger the test suites against only a single provider (rather than everything configured in your config.yaml) then you can use the following (with the appropriate provider specified):

```
/run app-test-suites-single PROVIDER=capa
```

## Running Tests Locally

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have [Ginkgo installed](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#installing-ginkgo)

Before you can run tests locally you must set the following required environment variables:

- `E2E_KUBECONFIG` must be set to the path to the kubeconfig of the test management cluster (e.g. `./kube/e2e.yaml`) - for the requirements of this kubeconfig please see [cluster-standup-teardown](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-standup-teardown) for more details.
- `E2E_KUBECONFIG_CONTEXT` must be set to the context to use for the management cluster in the kubeconfig (e.g. `capa`)
- `E2E_APP_VERSION` must be set to version of the app to test against (e.g. `3.5.1`). Note, this version must have already been published to the catalog.

Optionally, the following can be set to re-use an existing workload cluster:

- `E2E_WC_NAME` - the name of the workload cluster on the MC
- `E2E_WC_NAMESPACE` - the namespace the workload cluser is found in

Once those are set, you can trigger the E2E tests in you App repo with the following:

```sh
cd ./tests/e2e
ginkgo --timeout 4h -v -r ./suites/basic/
```

This will run the `basic` test suite. If you have others you wish to run, replace the directory with the test suite you want to trigger.

### Running local `apptest-framework` changes

If you need to run with a local copy of `apptest-framework` (such as when testing out changes to the framework) you can do so by adding the following to your Apps test go.mod (with the path correctly set to point to your checked out code):

```
replace github.com/giantswarm/apptest-framework => /path/to/my/apptest-framework
```

## Adding Tests

### Test Cases

Once bootstrapped your repo will have a test suite called `basic` that you can start adding tests to.

There are 4 phases in which you can add tests:

- `AfterClusterReady` - These are run first, as soon as the workload cluster is deemed to be ready, and should be used to check for any needed pre-requisites in the cluster.
- `BeforeUpgrade` - These are only run if performing an upgrade tests and are run between installing the latest released version of your App and the version being tested. These are used to test that the App is in an expected state before performing the upgrade.
- `Tests` - This is where most of your tests will go and will be run after your App has been installed and marked as "Deployed" in the cluster.
- `AfterSuite` - This is performed during the cleanup after the tests have completed. This function will be triggered before the test App is uninstalled and before the workload cluster is deleted.

To add new test cases you can either add them inline within the above functions or call out to other functions and modules without your codebase so you can better structure different tests together. Be sure to follow the Ginkgo docs on writing [Spec Subjects](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#spec-subjects-it).

### Test Suites

If you need to test different configured functionality of your App (e.g. a different set of values provided when installing) you can create a new test suite for each of these variations. Each test suite should be run in isolation in its own test workload cluster so it doesn't interfere with other tests.

To add a new test suite, create a new directory under `./tests/e2e/suites/` with the name of your new test suite and follow the same layout as the `basic` test suite.
